# Intro To Functions

The lesson contains several parts. In each part, you will
be creating a new function. They should increase in
difficulty, so doing them in order is recommended.

For each problem:
- Open partX.js in sublime
- Read the instructions
- Write the desired function
- Run "node partX.js" in the terminal
